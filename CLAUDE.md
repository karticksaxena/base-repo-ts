# Global Coding Rules

Backend-specific rules (NestJS + Fastify + Prisma + AG-UI: structure, DI, logging, exceptions, security, DB patterns) live in `backend/CLAUDE.md`; frontend rules (Next.js + shadcn/ui + CopilotKit) live in `frontend/CLAUDE.md`. Each loads only for sessions working in that folder. Tooling setup for both: `SETUP.md`.

## Core Rules
1. **BE CRITICAL** — challenge bad ideas, point out flaws
2. **PERFORMANCE FIRST** — analyze complexity before coding; avoid O(n²), use `Map`/`Set` lookups, batch ops
3. **MODULAR** — functions <50 lines, files <500 lines, extract shared logic to `common/`
4. **READ CONTEXT FIRST** — use tools before editing
5. **ASK WHEN UNCLEAR** — never guess
6. **EXPLAIN APPROACH** — describe plan before implementing
7. **DRY** — Don't Repeat Yourself. If the same logic exists in 2+ places, extract it. One change, one place.
8. **YAGNI** — You Aren't Gonna Need It. Don't build for hypothetical futures. Add complexity when actually needed.
9. **KISS** — Keep It Simple, Stupid. Choose the simplest solution that works. More abstraction ≠ better code.
